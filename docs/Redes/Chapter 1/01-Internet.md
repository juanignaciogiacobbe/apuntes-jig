> [!IMPORTANT] Internet
> A computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world. All of these devices are called **hosts** or **end systems**. End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches.


> [!IMPORTANT] A services description for the Internet
> We can also describe the Internet as an infrastructure that provides services to applications. The applications are said to be distributed applications, since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.
> Internet applications run on end systems, they do not run in the packet switches in the network core.



> [!IMPORTANT] Packets
> When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information are known as packets.


> [!IMPORTANT] Internet Service Providers(ISPs)
> End systems access the internet through ISPs.
> Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links.
> The ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected.
