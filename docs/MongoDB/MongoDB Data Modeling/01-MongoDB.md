> [!IMPORTANT] MongoDB
> General purpose Document Database. -> It can handle most types of workloads, including real-time analytics.
> - Structures data in documents.
> - Model data of any shape or structure.
> - Supports a flexible schema model and polymorphic data(We can iterate quickly and evolve as our requirements change).
> - Characteristics: Scalability, Resilience, Speed of Development, Privacy and Security.


> [!IMPORTANT] Document
> - The basic unit of data in MongoDB.
> - They offer a flexible way to work with data -> Easier how to plan application data will correspond to data in the database.
> - They may contain different fields, and fields may contain different types.


> [!IMPORTANT] Collections
> Are analogous to tables in relational databases.-> If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.
> - Grouping of documents
> - We can store documents with different structures in the same collection together.


> [!IMPORTANT] Database
> Container for collections.


> [!IMPORTANT] Atlas
> - The MongoDB database is at the core of atlas -> Our multi-cloud developer data platform.
> - It offers full text search, and data visualization.


> [!IMPORTANT] Atlas Data Explorer
> Interact and manage data from Atlas UI.
> - We will use to create and view databases, collections and documents in our Atlas Database Deployment.
