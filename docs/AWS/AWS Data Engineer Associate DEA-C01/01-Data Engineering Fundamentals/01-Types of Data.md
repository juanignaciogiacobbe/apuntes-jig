# Types of Data

## Structured Data
- Organized in a defined manner or schema, typically found in relational databases.
- Easily queryable, organized in rows and columns, has a consistent structure.
- Example: Database tables.

## Unstructured Data
- Data that doesn't have a predefined structure or schema.
- Not easily queryable without preprocessing(may come in various formats).
- Examples: Text files without a fixed format.

## Semi-Structured Data
- Data that is not organized as structured data but has some level of structure in the form of tags, hierarchies, or other patterns.
- Elements might be tagged or categorized in some way. It's more flexible than structured data but not as chaotic as unstructured data.
- Examples: XML and JSON files.
