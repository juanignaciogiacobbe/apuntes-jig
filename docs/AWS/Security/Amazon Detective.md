# Amazon Detective
- [[AWS/Security/Amazon GuardDuty|GuardDuty]], Macie and [[AWS/Security/AWS Security Hub|Security Hub]] are used to identify potential security issues, or findings 
- Sometimes security findings require deeper analysis to isolate the root cause and take action - it's a complex process.
- Amazon Detective analyzes, investigates, and quickly identifies the root cause of security issues or suspicious activities(using ML and Graphs).
- Automatically collects and processes events from VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, GuardDuty and create a unified view. -> Produce visualizations with details and context to get the root cause.
