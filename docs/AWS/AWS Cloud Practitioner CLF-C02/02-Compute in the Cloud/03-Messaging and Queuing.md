# Messaging and Queuing

!!! note "Messaging and Queuing"
> **Applications are made of multiple components. The components comunicate with each other** to transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application running.


!!! note "Monolithic Applications"
> - Type of architecture where the **applications has tightly coupled components**. These components might include databases, servers, the user interface, business logic, and so on.
> - A single component fails -> The entire application fails
> - To help maintain application availability when a single component fails, you can desing your application through a microservices approach.

!!! note "Microservices"
> - Application components are loosely coupled.
> - A single component fails -> The other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other. 
> - **The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing**.
> - **When designing applications on AWS, you can take a microservices approach with services and components that fulfill different functions.** 
> - Two services facilitate application integration: Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

# Amazon Simple Notification Service(SNS)
- Is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
- Is a publish/subscribe service. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers.

!!! note "Amazon Simple Queue Service(Amazon SQS)"
> - Messaging queuing service.
> - You can send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. In Amazon SQS, an application sends messages into a queue. A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.
